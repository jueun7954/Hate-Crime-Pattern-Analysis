# Hate Crime Pattern Analysis
"Exploring the Impact of Social and Environmental Factors on Racial Bias: Analyzing Hate Crimes Through Socio-Economic and Political Lenses." 

The project examines trends in hate crime over time, focusing on the role of COVID-19 and state-level socio-economic factors. Using various statistical methods like Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis, panel data regression, and predictive models (ARIMA), this research investigates which factors drive racial bias and whether large-scale social changes exacerbate hate crimes.
